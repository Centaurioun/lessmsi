# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to LessMSI. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

# Questions, Suggestions, Bugs 
Feel free to submit issues at https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi/issues to report bugs, request enhancements or just ask a question.


# Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Pull Requests ##
To get your changes into a Lessmsi release, please fork the repository, commit your changes to your fork, then submit a pull request. If you're not super confident about pull requests see Github's great documentation about how to do so at https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/
